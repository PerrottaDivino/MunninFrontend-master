This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Its a MVP challenge created at the purpose to see if its possible,move from react.js/carbon design/ node.js / Cloudant and create a new project from 0 to a full e-commerce with some tools in mind on less than a week:

*Typescript/Next.js at frontend.
*Prisma ORM and PostgreeSql at Back-end.
*Axios
*React Query
*Turborepo
*Chakra Ui/TailwindCss or React Hook Forms (The choice its Tailwind)
*NextAuth
*NestJs/T3 App.
*Cms: Strapi or KeystoneJs.
*Supabase or NHost
*AWS S3 or Cloudnary for static files at CDN
*Published at  Vercel or Railway:
    Http://

*Always thinking about Security,Scale,performance and portability.
*Jest for tests, most of then with mock fast test, clock its ticking.
